# DataVizDemo
Data visualization workflow in R presented on 9 Feb 2022 at Penn State, Environmental and Water Resources Engineering Seminar. 

Co-presenter: Sarah Torhan

* ExampleCode.Rmd : R notebook of the relevant code
* ExampleCode.pdf : pdf output of the notebook with figures

The code walks through 3 examples: a labels scatter plot, a faceted bar plot with errorbars, and a set of heatmap/contour plots combined with patchwork. Data for the scatter plot is adapted from:

Sigvart Evjen, Anne Fiksdahl, Diego D.D. Pinto, Hanna K. Knuutila. "New polyalkylated imidazoles tailored for carbon dioxide capture." International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, vol 76, 2018, pp. 167-174. DOI: 10.1016/j.ijggc.2018.06.017

with additional post-processing as detailed in:

Jonathan Boualavong, Christopher A. Gorski. "Electrochemically Mediated CO2 Capture Using Aqueous Cu(II)/Cu(I) Imidazole Complexes." ACS ES&T Engineering, vol 1, no 7, 2021, pp. 1084-1093. DOI: 10.1021/acsestengg.1c00068

The rest of the data is slightly modified versions of unpublished data with relevant details removed and particular features exaggerated.
